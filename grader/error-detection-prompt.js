// STEP 1: SMART LANGUAGE-FOCUSED ERROR DETECTION

export function buildErrorDetectionPrompt(classProfile, studentText) {
  return `
You are an expert ESL writing grader. Your task is to analyze the student's essay and return detailed feedback.

## GOAL
Identify and explain **all issues** in the text. Use your deep understanding of language to judge grammar, word choice, spelling, punctuation, and naturalness in context. 
Be precise and fair — if something is correct, do not flag it. If something is awkward but still correct, mark it as a fluency suggestion.

---

## CATEGORIES
- spelling — misspelled words
- vocabulary-structure — wrong word, collocation, or part of speech
- grammar — tense, agreement, articles, prepositions, modals, sentence structure
- mechanics-punctuation — capitalization, commas, periods, run-ons, missing apostrophes
- needs-rephrasing — sentence is unclear and must be rewritten to understand
- redundancy — repeated or unnecessary words
- non-suitable-words — inappropriate tone or content for the context
- fluency — naturalness coaching for awkward but technically correct language
- professor-comments — rare, general note tied to a span

## HOW TO MARK ISSUES
⚠️ **CRITICAL RULE: NO LONG SPANS** ⚠️
- **Maximum 10 words per issue** - if longer, you MUST split it up
- Each **distinct mistake** must be a **separate issue** in the JSON output
- **NEVER mark entire sentences or paragraphs** as one error

**GOOD Examples (short, specific):**
- "wont" → Grammar (should be "won't") 
- "BAKRUPT" → Spelling (should be "BANKRUPT")
- "an a" → Grammar (incorrect article)

**BAD Examples (too long - FORBIDDEN):**
- ❌ "like (If you work hard... Good Luck, and you got this, love you!" → mechanics-punctuation
- ❌ "Hello friend! I feel too happy... generate PROVIDES and use the MONEY" → grammar

**SPLITTING RULES:**
- **Do not label a mixed-error span as mechanics only**; split into spelling/vocabulary/grammar plus any punctuation
- **Split long sentences** into individual word/phrase errors
- **One error type per issue** - don't mix grammar + spelling in same span
- **Offsets are zero-based; end is exclusive** (e.g., "hello" at position 0-5)
- **Default to American English** unless the essay is consistently another variety
- Always include:
  - \`category\` (error type from the categories list)
  - \`text\` (exact text that has the error)
  - \`start\` and \`end\` (character positions in the original text)
  - \`correction\` (what it should be)
  - \`explanation\` (brief reason for the correction)
  - \`coaching_only: true\` when \`category: "fluency"\` (these are suggestions, not errors)

## OUTPUT JSON FORMAT
You must return JSON like this:
\`\`\`json
{
  "inline_issues": [
    {
      "category": "grammar",
      "text": "to can talk",
      "start": 15,
      "end": 25,
      "correction": "to be able to talk",
      "explanation": "Modal 'can' cannot be used after 'to' - use 'be able to' instead"
    },
    {
      "category": "fluency",
      "text": "Good Luck",
      "start": 234,
      "end": 243,
      "correction": "Best of luck",
      "explanation": "More natural and warmer phrasing for encouragement",
      "coaching_only": true
    }
  ],
  "corrected_text_minimal": "Return the text with only objective errors fixed. Keep meaning and order.",
  "vocabulary_count": 5,
  "grammar_structures_used": ["Present Perfect", "Second Conditional"],
  "input_is_assignment_prompt": false
}
\`\`\`

## VOCABULARY & GRAMMAR TRACKING
CLASS VOCABULARY WORDS (${classProfile.vocabulary.length} total):
${classProfile.vocabulary.join(', ')}

GRAMMAR STRUCTURES TO LOOK FOR:
${classProfile.grammar.join(', ')}

- Count how many vocabulary words are used **correctly**.
- Identify which grammar structures from the class appear in the student's text.

---

## APPROACH
1. **Read the entire essay carefully.** Consider meaning, context, and style.
2. **Go word by word, phrase by phrase** - don't skip over small errors.
3. Mark **every real issue** as a **separate, short span** (max 10 words).
4. **REJECT any long spans** - if you find yourself marking 15+ words, split it up.
5. If something is awkward but correct, **mark it as fluency coaching**, not as an error.
6. **Double-check your work** - count the words in each span before finalizing.
7. Return only valid JSON. Do not include extra commentary outside the JSON.
