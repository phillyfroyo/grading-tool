═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY: MERCIFUL GRADING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOUR ONLY JOB: Assign fair, encouraging scores based on the rubric.

ERRORS ALREADY DETECTED: The color-coded essay markings are complete. You received:
- ${errorDetectionResults.inline_issues.length} total errors found
- Grammar errors, spelling issues, etc. all pre-identified
- Vocabulary count: ${errorDetectionResults.vocabulary_count || 0}
- Grammar structures used: ${errorDetectionResults.grammar_structures_used?.join(', ') || 'none identified'}

NOW GRADE MERCIFULLY:
- Even with many errors marked, students deserve fair scores
- Focus on communication and effort over perfection
- Give credit for what students do well
- Use encouraging, supportive language

CEFR Level: ${cefrLevel} (${levelInfo.name})
Grading Approach: ${levelInfo.description}

ZERO SCORE RULES (automatic 0 if any apply):
${rubric.zero_rules.map(rule => `- ${rule}`).join('\n')}

GRADING CATEGORIES (weights and bands):
${categories.map(cat => {
  const category = rubric.categories[cat];
  return `${category.name} (${category.weight}%):
${category.bands.map(band => `  ${band.range}: ${band.description}`).join('\n')}`;
}).join('\n\n')}

CLASS-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Target word count: ${rubric.layout_rules.target_word_count_min}-${rubric.layout_rules.target_word_count_max} words
- Minimum transition words: ${rubric.layout_rules.transition_words_min}
- Vocabulary to count: ${classProfile.vocabulary.join(', ')}
- Grammar structures to identify: ${classProfile.grammar.join(', ')}

SCORING LENIENCY RULES:
- Do not assign lowest band unless comprehension is impeded  
- Cap per-category deductions for frequent minor issues at -40% of category weight
- If word count within target ±25 words, don't drop Layout below middle band solely for transitions
- If no class vocabulary provided, don't penalize - evaluate natural variety instead
- Try to include 2 positives before critical feedback in each category (praise-then-coach)
- Score naturally based on performance, don't artificially floor scores
- Be merciful and supportive in score assignment

PERFECT PERFORMANCE RULE:
- If no errors found in a category, award FULL POINTS (15/15 for major categories, 10/10 for fluency)
- Don't withhold points "just in case" - if performance is excellent, give excellent grades
- Only reduce points when you can identify specific, fixable issues

STUDENT TEXT:
"${studentText}"

DETECTED ERRORS SUMMARY:
${errorDetectionResults.inline_issues.map(issue => 
  `- ${issue.category || issue.type}: ${issue.explanation || issue.message || `${issue.text} → ${issue.correction}`}`
).join('\n')}

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):

    "grammar": {"points": 11, "out_of": 15, "rationale": "Positive feedback first, then specific coaching with examples"},
    "vocabulary": {"points": 12, "out_of": 15, "rationale": "Praise effort, suggest improvements with examples"},

    "fluency": {"points": 8, "out_of": 10, "rationale": "Encourage flow improvements with transition suggestions"},
    "layout": {"points": 12, "out_of": 15, "rationale": "Credit structure, suggest enhancements"},
    "content": {"points": 13, "out_of": 15, "rationale": "Value ideas and personal connection, suggest depth"}

  ]
}

Categories must be exactly: grammar, vocabulary, spelling, mechanics, fluency, layout, content

Be generous and supportive in scoring. Students need encouragement to improve.`;
