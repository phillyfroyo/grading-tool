// HYBRID STEP 2: ERROR RECONCILIATION, VERIFICATION, AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

You are an error verification specialist. Your job is to create a final, high-quality error list by comparing two detection passes.

## YOUR TASK
Compare the conservative and thorough error lists, then create a verified, high-quality final list.

## INPUT DATA

**CONSERVATIVE ERRORS** (${conservativeErrors.length} errors - high confidence):
${JSON.stringify(conservativeErrors, null, 2)}

**THOROUGH ERRORS** (${thoroughErrors.length} errors - all potential issues):
${JSON.stringify(thoroughErrors, null, 2)}

## RECONCILIATION PROCESS

### STEP 1: IDENTIFY CONSENSUS ERRORS
- Find errors that appear in BOTH lists (same text, similar span)
- These are HIGH CONFIDENCE - definitely keep them
- Mark these as consensus_errors

### STEP 2: VERIFY THOROUGH-ONLY ERRORS
For each error that appears ONLY in the thorough list:
- **Is it a real error?** Check against grammar/spelling rules
- **Is it clearly wrong?** Or just a stylistic preference?
- **Keep if**: It's a genuine error (even if subtle)
- **Remove if**: It's subjective, preference-based, or not actually wrong

### STEP 3: QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (Critical!)
For ALL errors (consensus + verified), check and fix:

**A) SPAN VALIDATION (Atomic Error Rule)**
- ✅ Is the span atomic? (1 word for spelling, 1-2 for vocab/mechanics, minimal for grammar)
- ❌ Does it include unnecessary context words?
- **FIX**: Reduce span to minimum needed to show the error

Examples:
- ❌ "the bussiness area" → ✅ "bussiness" (spelling - just the word)
- ❌ "I dont like going" → ✅ "dont" (mechanics - just the word needing apostrophe)
- ❌ "i heard for one friend" → ✅ "for" (grammar - just the wrong preposition)

**B) CORRECTION VALIDATION**
- ✅ Is the correction accurate and complete?
- ✅ Does it fix the specific error highlighted?
- **FIX**: Improve corrections that are vague or incorrect

**C) NOTE/EXPLANATION QUALITY**
- ✅ Is the explanation helpful for learning?
- ✅ Is it concise (3-10 words)?
- ❌ Is it missing when it would help?
- ❌ Is it present when not needed (obvious corrections)?
- **FIX**: Add helpful explanations, remove unnecessary ones, improve unclear ones

Examples of good explanations:
- "Subject-verb agreement"
- "Use 'from' not 'for' with 'heard'"
- "Collocation: 'do homework'"
- "Participle adjective: use -ed form"

### STEP 4: REMOVE DUPLICATES
- If two errors cover the same text span, keep only one
- Choose the one with better category/correction/explanation

    // Each with validated spans and improved notes
  ],
  "corrected_text_minimal": "Student text with all verified errors corrected"
}

## QUALITY STANDARDS

Before adding any error to final_errors, verify:
1. ✅ The error is real (not a preference)
2. ✅ The span is atomic (minimum words needed)
3. ✅ The correction is accurate
4. ✅ The explanation helps (or is omitted if obvious)
5. ✅ No duplicate errors

## IMPORTANT RULES

**ATOMIC SPAN ENFORCEMENT:**
- spelling: 1 word MAX
- mechanics: 1-2 words MAX
- vocabulary: 1-2 words MAX
- grammar: as few words as possible
- fluency: minimum needed

**FALSE POSITIVE REMOVAL:**
Be aggressive in removing:
- Stylistic preferences ("big" vs "large")
- Valid alternatives
- Subjective improvements
- Regional variations

**EXPLANATION GUIDELINES:**
- Add when error type isn't obvious
- Add when explaining "why" helps learning
- Omit when correction is self-explanatory
- Keep brief (3-10 words)

## STUDENT TEXT FOR REFERENCE:
