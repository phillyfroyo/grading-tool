# Future Ideas & Improvements

This file contains ideas for future development that haven't been implemented yet due to bandwidth constraints.

## ðŸ”¥ High Priority UI/UX Improvements

### Compact Batch Results UI
- [ ] **Compact the UI of the grader after results come in** - Show only student names initially
  - Clicking on a student name expands to show full grading details for that student only
  - This will organize the UI and improve UX for batch grading
  - Add status checkboxes for each student:
    - "Done" or "Mark Complete" checkbox after reviewing an essay
    - "Needs Review" checkbox to flag essays for later review
  - Individual download option next to each student name
  - "Download All" button at the bottom for bulk export
  - Improves organization and workflow for teachers grading multiple essays

### Button Order Fix
- [ ] **Reverse the order of "Add Another Essay" and "Grade Essay" buttons**
  - Current order is counterintuitive and leads to clicking wrong button
  - Grade Essay button should be more prominent/first
  - Improves user workflow and reduces errors
