## üìö GPT PROMPT & OUTPUT SYSTEM REFERENCE GUIDE

### **üìÅ Core GPT Files & Their Functions:**

#### **1. PROMPTS & CONFIGURATION**
- **`grader/grading-prompt.js`** - Generates Step 2 prompt for merciful scoring
- **`grader/error-detection-prompt.js`** - Generates Step 1 prompt for aggressive error finding
- **`grader/rubric.json`** - Scoring criteria (7 categories, 100 points total)

#### **2. GRADING ENGINES**
- **`grader/grader.js`** - Legacy single-step grader (310+ line prompt)
- **`grader/grader-two-step.js`** - Modern two-step approach (detection ‚Üí grading)

#### **3. OUTPUT PROCESSING**
- **`grader/formatter.js`** - Converts GPT JSON to color-coded HTML highlights
- **`src/services/temperatureService.js`** - Applies ¬±10% per temperature point adjustment

#### **4. CONTROLLERS & API**
- **`src/controllers/gradingController.js`** - Routes grading requests to appropriate engine
- **`src/controllers/profileController.js`** - Manages class profiles with custom prompts

### **üé® Color-Coding System:**
- **Orange** - Grammar errors
- **Green** - Vocabulary issues
- **Red** - Spelling mistakes
- **Gray Background** - Mechanics/punctuation
- **Blue Background** - Fluency problems
- **Yellow Background** - Professor comments

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues to Address:**

**1. Highlights Problems:**
- GPT often highlights entire sentences instead of specific words
- Offset positions frequently incorrect (requires post-processing fixes)
- Categories sometimes misclassified (grammar vs fluency confusion)

**2. Teacher Feedback Issues:**
- Sometimes too generic or repetitive
- May not align well with actual errors found
- Positive feedback requirement not always natural

### **üîÑ The Two-Step Process Flow:**

```
Student Essay ‚Üí Step 1: Error Detection (temp 0.5) ‚Üí Safety Patches
‚Üí Step 2: Rubric Scoring (temp 0.2) ‚Üí Temperature Adjustment ‚Üí Final Output
```

### **Key Prompt Engineering Elements:**

1. **Atomic Error Rule**: Single word errors should have single word highlights
2. **Positive Feedback Mandate**: All rationales must start with encouragement
3. **2nd Person Rule**: Use "you" not "the student" in feedback
4. **CEFR Leniency**: Multipliers applied based on student level (B2: 1.15x)

### **üîß Recommendations for GPT Output Improvements:**

1. **Simplify Prompts** - Reduce 310+ line prompts to focused instructions
2. **Improve Offset Accuracy** - Add quote-based error identification
3. **Enhance Error Classification** - Clear grammar vs fluency decision tree
4. **Optimize Temperature Settings** - Higher for detection (0.3-0.5), lower for grading (0.1-0.2)
5. **Better Safety Nets** - Improve missing functions and validation patterns

## üî• High Priority UI/UX Improvements

### Compact Batch Results UI
- [ ] **Compact the UI of the grader after results come in** - Show only student names initially
  - Clicking on a student name expands to show full grading details for that student only
  - This will organize the UI and improve UX for batch grading
  - Add status checkboxes for each student:
    - "Done" or "Mark Complete" checkbox after reviewing an essay
    - "Needs Review" checkbox to flag essays for later review
  - Individual download option next to each student name
  - "Download All" button at the bottom for bulk export
  - Improves organization and workflow for teachers grading multiple essays

## üöÄ Potential Features

### AI & Grading Improvements
- [ ] Multi-model grading comparison (GPT-4 vs Claude vs others)
- [ ] Student progress tracking across multiple essays
- [ ] Automated rubric generation based on assignment type
- [ ] Plagiarism detection integration
- [ ] Voice feedback generation (text-to-speech for teacher comments)

### User Experience
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Bulk essay processing (upload multiple files)
- [ ] Real-time collaborative grading (multiple teachers)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design improvements

### Analytics & Reporting
- [ ] Class performance analytics dashboard
- [ ] Individual student progress reports

### Scalability & Bulk Processing
- [ ] Explore batch grading capabilities for entire classes (20-30 students)
- [ ] Parallel prompt processing for simultaneous grading
- [ ] Queue management system for bulk operations
- [ ] Progress tracking for large batch jobs

### Integration Ideas
- [ ] LMS integration (Canvas, Blackboard, etc.)

- [ ] Student-facing feedback portal

### Development & Testing Tools
- [ ] Create sandbox page at /color with just the color-coded essay section for UI experimentation

## üåü Advanced Features
- [ ] AI writing assistant for students
- [ ] Automated essay outline generation
- [ ] Grammar explanation tooltips
- [ ] Interactive writing exercises
- [ ] Peer review system
